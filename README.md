## Concluding Thoughts
```
I built this little project as my introduction into Rust! I learned a ton about Rust's
ownership/borrowing paradigm, lifetimes <'a>, and memory-safety. The UI is as lightweight
as it gets and in the future I'd like to add more UI-features, but doing so would probably invovle
writing a new rust-twitter library (the ones that exist are great, but miss some crucial features) or
waiting for Rust's web development to mature a bit more. Nevertheless I've enjoyed my first Rust
project and can't wait to get more acquanited with the language.
